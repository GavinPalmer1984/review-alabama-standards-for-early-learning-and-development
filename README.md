# Cultural Context (page 9)

```
Children learn in the context of their unique heritage and family culture and values.
Children’s culture is the lens through which they experience activities and events, develop
relationships, and build knowledge. Children often reveal cultural differences in the
way they interact with adults and other children, how they use language, demonstrate
independence and self-reliance, or express emotions. Alabama’s Standards are culturally
relevant, respecting children and families’ differences.

McKenna and pscilocybn teach that culture is not your friend.  I try to teach my children about the culture.  I let them know that many of our family members expect you to say words like "please", "thank you", "sir", "mame", "excuse me", "excuse you", and all kinds of words depending on the situation.  Culture is similar to religion in that I don't want to push an organized religion on my children.  But I do want to teach them about the different organized religions.  When you force a culture or religion on a child you are changing the way that their brain will develop so that they are not as good at thinking as they could be.  When you require a child to say words they do not mean nor understand then you are teaching the child to be obedient.  You are also teaching the child to be dishonest to the core which inevitably results in suffering.
