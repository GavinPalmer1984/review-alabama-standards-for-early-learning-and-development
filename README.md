# Introduction

I am in the process of reviewing [Alabama's 2020 standards for early learning and development](https://github.com/GavinPalmer1984/review-alabama-standards-for-early-learning-and-development/blob/master/pdfs/LL_DECE_Standards_FullDraft9.pdf).

The authors have many ideas I agree with.  I am only adding my own ideas in the cases where the author's ideas seem to be insufficient.

Feel free to begin a conversation via pull request or you can reach me at `GavinPalmer1984 @ gmail.com`.

Children learn in the context of their unique heritage and family culture and values.
Children’s culture is the lens through which they experience activities and events, develop
relationships, and build knowledge. Children often reveal cultural differences in the
way they interact with adults and other children, how they use language, demonstrate
independence and self-reliance, or express emotions. Alabama’s Standards are culturally
relevant, respecting children and families’ differences.

McKenna and pscilocybn teach that culture is not your friend.  I try to teach my children about the culture.  I let them know that many of our family members expect you to say words like "please", "thank you", "sir", "mame", "excuse me", "excuse you", and all kinds of words depending on the situation.  Culture is similar to religion in that I don't want to push an organized religion on my children.  But I do want to teach them about the different organized religions.  When you force a culture or religion on a child you are changing the way that their brain will develop so that they are not as good at thinking as they could be.  When you require a child to say words they do not mean nor understand then you are teaching the child to be obedient.  You are also teaching the child to be dishonest to the core which inevitably results in suffering.

Early learning professionals can help children who have experienced trauma by
establishing strong, positive relationships with both children and their families. Adults need
to maintain consistent routines and use positive guidance strategies. The Standards, and
in particular, the domains of Approaches to Play and Learning, Physical Development and
Health, and Social Emotional Development offer developmental trajectories and strategies
to guide adults’ understanding of development-specific strategies to support traumatized
children.

Bad parenting is a big problem ultimately being ignored here.  It isn't fair to the child nor the teacher to keep children in homes with bad parents.  We should try to make sure children are raised with good parents.  Every parent who wants to give their child away in exchange for anything would be a bad parent.  I am thinking about the story of the [Judgement of Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_of_Solomon) regarding two women claiming to be the mother of a baby.  One kind of offer to a bad parent would be a one time payment in exchange for the parents giving up the child.  An additional offer might require sterilization of one or both parents.  This kind of strategy should end up reducing the total costs and risks associated with bad parenting in our world.  In general, a strategy can incentivize certain kinds of behaviors.  The general idea is to provide an incentive for bad parents to not have children.  And that incentive should be larger than the incentive for bad parents to have children.

Every child is special. No two children are the same. Every child has unique personality traits,
temperament, and even physical appearances. Every child is a competent learner with strengths,
abilities, and interests. Every child grows and learns in his/her own way at a self-defined pace;
some children may need additional support to guide their learning and development. Early
childhood professionals must use their understanding of each child’s uniqueness to adapt
experiences and environment to best meet their needs and maximize learning

I find that behind every strength is at least one weakness and behind every weakness is at least one strength.  This kind of awareness can help each individual to become more aware of their own strengths and weaknesses and other people's strengths and weaknesses.  This kind of awareness allows us to see our weaknesses in a better light.  I only mention this because the authors seem to deliberately avoid using the word "weak" or "weakness".  This avoidance of the word and the reality of the situation is not helpful.
